# Encryption-and-decryption
Python code for encrypting and decrypting a given text file.  This program uses Fernet symmetric encryption method, which is based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. Fernet combines AES encryption with HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for secure encryption and data integrity verification.
